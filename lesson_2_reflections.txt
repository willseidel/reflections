Initializing a repository creates the file structure for storing metadata associated with git.

staging area is a place to organize a group of files from your working directory before committing them to the repository. Without this you'd have to either list all files you want in a single commit command or commit one file at a time.

Staging area can be used to make sure you have all files you want to commit ready to go.
